\subsection{}

Here is some preliminary question information that might be useful.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is part (a)
    \item The filter still works even if there aren't any parts
\end{enumerate}

\begin{AnyName}
    \paragraph{Solution}

    This is the final answer. It contains the solutions for all parts without breaking them up.

    $$
        1+1 = 2
    $$

    The solution is copied across all parts.

\end{AnyName}

\subsection{}

This is question 2.

\begin{AnyName}
    \paragraph{Solution} And here's the solution
